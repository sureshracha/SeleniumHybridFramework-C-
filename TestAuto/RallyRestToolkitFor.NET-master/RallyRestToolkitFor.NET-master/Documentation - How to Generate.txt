In order to generate Sandcastle based documentation, please follow these steps:

Definitions:
SHFB = "Sandcastle Help File Builder"

Download and install the tools required to run SHFB: https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB
Launch the SHFB and open the file DocumentationGeneration.shfbproj, or double click the file to open it.
Select Documentation, Build Project.

Namespace summaries can be edited within the SHFB application under "Summaries"

Prior to building documentation, you must have done a Debug build as this generates the source files for documentation. One 
annoying "feature" is that when the SHFB program is open, it locks DLLs an you cannot compile from Visual Studio without 
shutting down SHFB first.

Known Issues:
CHM (HTML Help 1) based documentation doesn't always generate correctly, so it is kept off by default in the project file.

A good reference for code documentation to ensure it is correctly listed in the Sandcastle documentation is located in this directory. Original document was found at:
